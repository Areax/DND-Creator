LIST OF THINGS (In order of first to last)

- Add the quit button
- Figure out a super elegant solution so that instead of scanning,
the code stops and waits for the enter press then reads from the text line.
Right now the code "crashes" if it hits a scanner.
- Change the colors so that it looks prettier
- Add class abilities
- Add race support/modifiers
- Make it so characters can equip weapons
- Solve the health calculation glitch
- Reformat the GUI if possible to allow more room for things
- Make a start menu
